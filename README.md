###  About Me :

I graduated <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/uikit/logo.png" width="15">  Le Wagon in March '23 and am now an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I particularly enjoy front end technologies. 

In March '23 I was busy working on [myRoutes](http://www.my-routes.co.uk) - Maximise your travel efficiency! 

I also opened a Shopify store selling Motorcycle accessories at [MotorcycleMania](http://www.motorcyclemania.co.uk) although have closed this temporarily. 

Since these projects, I have been studying a mixture of languages including React, Python and Swfit with codecademy. 

In August I started AWS Cloud Practitioner, Architect in September and in October I continue the Professional/Advanced Architecting course. 

I moved houses at the end of the year, and am now looking at current opportunities.
